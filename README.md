# dockerDGC

Docker implementation that will require a version of the DGC or CPSH installer file. The name of that file needs to be updated in the Dockerfile. Also note the inclusion of a user account "woffles" - that's my cat - you may want to find/replace "woffles" with whatever you like! Update the "config.json" file accordingly.
